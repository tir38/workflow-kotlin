# compose

This module currently only hosts integration tests to verify that Compose can be used with the
workflow navigation infrastructure (ViewTreeOwners etc). Since it is only tests, it is not shipped
as an artifact. Eventually, it will host actual Compose integration as well, at which point we will
start shipping it.
